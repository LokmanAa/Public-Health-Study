# Public Health Study on Global Malnutrition Using Python

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a public health study focusing on the state of malnutrition worldwide for the year 2017. Our mission is to address several critical questions regarding undernutrition and its implications. Utilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we aim to uncover insights into the proportion of undernourished people, the theoretical number of people who could be fed, the internal food availability utilization in each country, the countries most affected by undernutrition, the beneficiaries of international aid, the role of cereals in diets, and the impact of exports versus production on food availability.

# Data Preparation

- Importing Libraries: Setting up the Python environment with necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Importing Data: Loading the FAO datasets required for the analysis.
- Data Processing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis, focusing on: Population metrics. Undernutrition figures. Food aid data. Food availability information.

# Data Analysis

- Proportion of People in a State of Undernutrition: Calculating and analyzing the percentage of the undernourished population by country.
- Theoretical Number of People Who Could Be Fed: Estimating how many people could theoretically be fed based on the available food supply.
- Theoretical Number of People Who Could Be Fed with Plant Products: Estimating the number of people who could be fed exclusively on plant-based diets.
- Use of Domestic Food Availability: Analyzing how each country utilizes its internal food supply.
- Countries with the Highest Proportion of Undernourished Individuals: Identifying and examining the countries suffering the most from undernutrition.
- Countries Benefiting Most from International Aid: Determining which countries have received the most food aid since 2013.
- Per Capita Availability in Each Country: Analyzing food availability per inhabitant in each country.
- Role of Cereals in Nutrition: Investigating the significance of cereals in global diets.
- Case Study: Cassava in Thailand: A detailed look at the role of cassava in Thailand as an example of a staple foodâ€™s impact.

# Conclusion:

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of malnutrition globally in 2017, utilizing Python for data processing and analysis. By exploring various dimensions of food security and nutrition, we hope to contribute valuable insights to the public health community and support efforts to combat malnutrition worldwide.
